Parse Servers  
This program has 5 datanodes and 5 servers through which we will be exchanging messages with each other.  
There is also a JSON file that represents structured information organized as an object,   
where the keys are numbers from 0 to 5, and the values are arrays or numbers. Additionally,   
there is a client file that creates a Client class with an upload_info method that performs a POST request to the server using the requests library.
